# Builds vkgears, the Vulkan gears of mesa-demos, as a static program against
# ferrousli with Mesa's Venus driver linked into it: Vulkan in the guest,
# executed by the host's GPU through virtio-gpu (docs/GPU.md §6.1).
#
#     tools/ports/vkgears/build.sh [--arch x86_64]    # from ferrousli/
#
# Installs, under $FERRIX_PORTS (see ../common.sh):
#   <arch>/bin/vkgears
#
# A Vulkan program links against a loader, which opens a driver with dlopen.
# Ferrix's ports are static, and ferrousli's dlopen refuses a library with
# thread-local storage, which Mesa has. So the driver is linked into the
# program, and vkshim.py writes the loader's part: one function per Vulkan
# call vkgears makes, resolved through the driver's vk_icdGetInstanceProcAddr.
#
# Pinned, and refused if their checksums differ (sha256, taken on
# 2026-09-24 from the release downloads named below, except where foot's
# recipe already pins the same file):
#   libffi 3.5.2, wayland 1.24.0, wayland-protocols 1.45 and libxkbcommon
#   1.11.0, as foot has them: the Wayland client side;
#   libdrm 2.4.134, which Mesa finds and opens the render node with;
#   Mesa 26.2.3, for its Venus driver and nothing else;
#   Vulkan-Headers 1.4.363, the headers vkgears is compiled against and the
#   registry vkshim.py reads prototypes from;
#   libdecor 0.2.3, which vkgears asks for a window's decorations; with no
#   plugins it leaves them to the compositor;
#   mesa-demos 9.0.0, for vkgears.
#
# The build host needs meson, ninja, bison, pkg-config, python3 with mako,
# glslangValidator, and wayland-scanner 1.24.0, the library's own version.
#
# Patched, in patches/:
#   * vkgears-seat.patch: vkgears asked the seat for a keyboard whether or not
#     the seat had one, which is a protocol error that ends the connection
#     when it has none. It now waits for the capability.
#   * vkgears-xkb.patch: vkgears made its keymap context with XKB's default
#     include path, and libxkbcommon refuses to make one when that directory
#     is not there -- Ferrix carries no XKB data -- so the context was null
#     and the first keymap crashed on it. The compositor sends a whole keymap,
#     which needs no include path, so none is asked for.
#   * vkgears-dispatch.patch: vkgears polled its display without waiting and
#     then read it with wl_display_dispatch, which waits for an event of the
#     default queue. Mesa's Wayland code reads the same display from threads
#     of its own, and when one of them took what made the socket readable,
#     vkgears waited for the next event -- which a compositor waiting for
#     vkgears' next frame never sends. It reads with prepare_read and
#     read_events now, as libwayland asks of a display shared between
#     threads. Seen against hyprix, which offers wp_fifo_v1, so Mesa asks for
#     no frame callbacks whose arrival had been hiding the race.
#   * venus-open-by-name.patch: Venus finds its render node through libdrm's
#     drmGetDevices2, which reads sysfs, and Ferrix had none when this port
#     was made. When that finds nothing, the render nodes are opened by name
#     and the first whose driver is virtio_gpu is taken. Ferrix's /sys may
#     now be enough for libdrm; the patch can go once a boot shows it is.
#
# What is built without, and why:
#   * every driver but Venus, and OpenGL, EGL, GBM and GLX: vkgears is Vulkan;
#   * zlib, libdisplay-info, udev and the shader cache in Mesa: Venus sends
#     SPIR-V to the host and compiles nothing, and has no display of its own;
#   * libdecor's plugins, which are loaded with dlopen and draw with cairo or
#     GTK: the compositor decorates the window;
#   * vkgears' X11 support.
#
# Run it with MESA_VK_WSI_DEBUG=sw until the compositor has dmabuf: the frame
# is drawn by the host's GPU and copied into shared memory for the
# compositor, rather than handed over as a GPU buffer (docs/GPU.md §6.1).
