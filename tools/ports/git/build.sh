#   <arch>/usr/libexec/git-core/        the helpers git runs that are not
#                                       built in: git-remote-http and its
#                                       https and ftp links, the shell scripts,
#                                       and git-upload-pack and its two fellow

# Pinned, and refused if its checksum differs: kernel.org's git-2.55.0.tar.xz,
# by the sha256 kernel.org publishes in sha256sums.asc.
#
# What git is built without, and why:
#   * Perl, Python and Tcl/Tk: none is on the image, so git send-email, git p4,
#     gitk and git gui are left out;
#   * gettext and iconv: ferrousli has neither yet, so messages are English
#     and commit encodings are not re-encoded;
#   * expat: pushing over WebDAV needs it; fetching and cloning over HTTP(S)
#     do not.
#   * Rust: git's Rust half is built by cargo for the host, against glibc's
#     Rust standard library, which cannot be linked into a program on
#     ferrousli. NO_RUST keeps the C implementations it replaces.
#
# And with git's own regex rather than ferrousli's: git needs REG_STARTEND,
# which musl's regex, and so ferrousli's, does not have. Alpine builds git for
# musl the same way.
