//! `crypt.h`: one-way password hashing.
//!
//! `crypt` reads the hash to use from the setting string it is given, as every
//! implementation since the traditional two-character salt has. The order is
//! musl 1.2.5's `crypt_r.c` (MIT):
//!
//! | Setting | Hash |
//! |---|---|
//! | `$1$salt$` | MD5, in [`md5`] |
//! | `$2?$…` | blowfish, which is not here and gives `"*"` |
//! | `$5$[rounds=n$]salt$` | SHA-256, in [`sha2`] |
//! | `$6$[rounds=n$]salt$` | SHA-512, in [`sha2`] |
//! | `_`, 4 characters of count, 4 of salt | BSDi's extended DES, in [`des`] |
//! | anything else | the traditional DES hash of its first two characters, in [`des`] |
//!
//! Like musl's, a setting beginning with `$` that names none of these hashes
//! is not refused but read as a DES salt: `$9$salt$` hashes under the salt
//! `$9`. A blowfish setting gives `"*"`, which matches no password, rather
//! than a hash from the wrong algorithm, so a blowfish entry in `/etc/shadow`
//! refuses the login rather than accepting it.
//!
//! The result is written into storage the caller can read until the next call:
//! a static buffer for `crypt`, and the caller's `struct crypt_data` for
//! `crypt_r`. Neither ever fails with a null pointer. A setting that cannot be
//! used gives `"*"`, or `"x"` if the setting itself begins with `*`, as musl
//! does: a locked entry of `*` then never equals the hash of any password
//! under it.
